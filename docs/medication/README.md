# Medication Management

### 1. Introduction
The Medication Management feature provides users with a "Digital Medicine Cabinet" to keep track of their prescribed medications, dosages, and frequency. This simple yet crucial tool helps improve medication adherence and provides a clear record for both patients and providers.

### 2. Integration in MediConnect
This is a self-contained, client-side feature managed within a single React component.

- **Frontend Component**: The entire feature is handled by `src/components/medications/medication-manager.tsx`. It uses React state to manage the list of medications.
- **State Management**: An array of `Medication` objects is held in the component's state. All actions (add, remove) directly manipulate this state array. In a real-world application, these actions would trigger API calls to a Firestore backend.
- **Add Medication UI**: A modal dialog (`Dialog` from shadcn/ui) is used to capture the details of a new medication (name, dosage, frequency, reason). This provides a clean user experience without navigating away from the main list.
- **Display**: Medications are rendered as a list of cards, each showing the medication's details and a "remove" button.

### 3. Benefits
- **Improved Adherence**: Helps patients remember their medications and dosages.
- **Clear Record**: Provides a single source of truth for a patient's medication history, which can be easily shared with healthcare providers.
- **Simplicity**: The UI is straightforward and easy to use, encouraging adoption.
- **Error Prevention**: The "Add Medication" form includes basic validation to ensure key details are not missed.

### 5. Key Code Snippets
**State and Add Handler (`MedicationManager.tsx`):**
```javascript
const [medications, setMedications] = useState<Medication[]>(initialMedications);

const handleAddMedication = () => {
  // Basic validation
  if (!newMedName || !newMedDosage || !newMedFrequency) {
    // ... show error toast
    return;
  }

  const newMedication: Medication = {
    id: Date.now(),
    name: newMedName,
    // ... other properties
  };
  setMedications([...medications, newMedication]);
  
  // ... reset form and close dialog
};
```

**Remove Handler (`MedicationManager.tsx`):**
```javascript
const handleRemoveMedication = (id: number) => {
  setMedications(medications.filter((med) => med.id !== id));
  // ... show confirmation toast
};
```

### 6. Testing Instructions
1.  **Add Medication**: Click the "Add Medication" button. Fill out the form with details for a new medication and click "Save." Verify the new medication appears in the list and a confirmation toast is shown.
2.  **Validation**: Click "Add Medication" and try to save without filling in the required fields (Name, Dosage, Frequency). Verify that an error toast appears and the dialog remains open.
3.  **Remove Medication**: Click the trash can icon next to an existing medication. Verify that it is removed from the list and a confirmation toast is shown.
4.  **State Persistence (UI)**: Add a new medication, navigate to another page in the app, and then return to the Medication Manager. Verify that the newly added medication is still present (demonstrating React state persistence during the session).
