# Medication Management

### 1. Introduction
The Medication Management feature provides users with a "Digital Medicine Cabinet," a simple yet crucial tool to help them keep track of their prescribed medications, dosages, and intake frequency. This feature aims to improve medication adherence and provide a clear, shareable record for both patients and their healthcare providers.

### 2. Integration in MediConnect
This is a self-contained, client-side feature managed within a single React component. It demonstrates the UI and state management for this functionality.

- **Frontend Component**: The entire feature is handled by `src/components/medications/medication-manager.tsx`. It uses React's `useState` hook to manage the list of medications.
- **State Management**: An array of `Medication` objects is held in the component's local state. All actions (add, remove) directly manipulate this state array using `setMedications`. In a real-world application, these actions would trigger API calls to a backend service (like Firestore) to persist the data.
- **Add Medication UI**: A modal dialog (`Dialog` from ShadCN UI) is used to capture the details of a new medication. This provides a clean user experience without navigating away from the main list. The form includes fields for the medication's name, dosage, frequency, and the reason for taking it.
- **Input Validation**: The "Add Medication" form includes basic client-side validation. The "Save Medication" button is disabled until the required fields (Name, Dosage, Frequency) are filled out, and an error toast is shown if the user attempts to save without this information.
- **Display and Removal**: Medications are rendered as a list of cards, each showing the medication's details and an icon. Each card also includes a "Remove" button (a trash icon) that allows the user to delete a medication from their list.
- **User Feedback**: The component uses the `useToast` hook to provide feedback to the user when a medication is successfully added or removed.

### 3. Benefits
- **Improved Medication Adherence**: By providing a clear and accessible list, the feature helps patients remember their medications, dosages, and frequency.
- **Clear Health Record**: Provides a single source of truth for a patient's medication history, which can be easily reviewed during a consultation with a healthcare provider.
- **Simplicity and Usability**: The UI is straightforward and easy to use, with a clear "Add" button and intuitive "Remove" actions, encouraging user adoption.
- **Error Prevention**: The form's basic validation ensures that essential details are captured, improving the quality of the medication record.

### 5. Key Code Snippets
**State and Add Handler (`MedicationManager.tsx`):**
```javascript
const [medications, setMedications] = useState<Medication[]>(initialMedications);
const { toast } = useToast();

const handleAddMedication = () => {
  // Basic validation
  if (!newMedName || !newMedDosage || !newMedFrequency) {
    toast({
      variant: "destructive",
      title: "Missing Information",
      description: "Please fill out all required medication details.",
    });
    return;
  }

  const newMedication: Medication = {
    id: Date.now(),
    name: newMedName,
    dosage: newMedDosage,
    // ... other properties
  };
  setMedications([...medications, newMedication]);
  
  toast({ title: "Medication Added" });
  // ... reset form state and close dialog
};
```

**Remove Handler (`MedicationManager.tsx`):**
```javascript
const handleRemoveMedication = (id: number) => {
  setMedications(medications.filter((med) => med.id !== id));
  toast({ title: "Medication Removed" });
};
```

### 6. Testing Instructions
1.  **Add a Medication**: Click the "Add Medication" button. Fill out the form with details for a new medication (e.g., "Ibuprofen", "200mg", "As needed for pain"). Click "Save." Verify the new medication appears in the list and a confirmation toast is shown.
2.  **Validation Check**: Click "Add Medication" again. Try to click "Save Medication" without filling in the required fields (Name, Dosage, Frequency). Verify that a destructive (red) error toast appears and the dialog remains open.
3.  **Remove a Medication**: Click the trash can icon next to an existing medication in the list. Verify that it is immediately removed and a confirmation toast is shown.
4.  **UI State**: Add a new medication. Navigate to another page in the app (e.g., the dashboard) and then return to the Medication Manager page. Verify that the newly added medication is still present (demonstrating that React state persists during the session).
